    The YZF-R1 is powered by a 998 cc, cross plane, 4-cylinder, 4-valve engine that develops 200 hp - without ram air pressurization. Derived from YZR-M1 cross plane technology, its cross plane crankshaft gives an uneven 270° - 180° - 90° - 180° firing sequence for high levels of linear torque with outstanding traction. The compact chassis features a magnesium rear frame and long swing arm for outstanding handling along with developed suspension and magnesium wheels. Its high tech electronic control technology - including its new Quick Shift System (QSS) offers more precise control.
    
    To achieve optimal performance the engine uses a high compression 01:01 PM cylinder head featuring a pent roof combustion chamber with large diameter intake and exhaust valves. And for instant response with high power and strong linear torque, the YZF-R1 is equipped with titanium con rods and forged aluminum pistons.
       For optimal intake efficiency, an YZR-M1 type central air inlet feeds a large capacity 10.5 liter air box. Fresh air is force fed into the electronically activated Yamaha Chip Controlled Intake (YCC-I) funnels that adjust their length to match </p>
